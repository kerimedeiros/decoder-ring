# Decoder Ring | Encryption/Decryption App

An application built to encode and decode messages based on 3 different cipher methods: Caesar, Polybius, and Substitution. Created utilizing the test-driven development method.

## Live Application

2. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the application locally.

## Project Reflection

This project was created as an assignment for my studies in Thinkful's Software Engineering Certification program. 

Project goals and learnings included: 
 - Building functions for an application that will either encode or decode a string using a variety of ciphers
 - Utilizing JavaScript testing frameworks (Mocha, Chat) to create a series of tests to confirm that each cipher works
